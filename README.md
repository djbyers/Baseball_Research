# Baseball_Research
This repository includes projects and research done for baseball/softball related projects, including work done while I was a student, both in class and with relations to the Sports Analytics Club of St. Olaf College, as well as the work necessary to complete the Society for American Baseball Research (SABR) Certification courses, and other personal passion projects.

A description of each section and the files contained within each is contained below:

## SABR Certification Material

#### SABR Course 2 Case Study

The final project to complete the level two SABR certification was a case study of whether or not the Padres should have signed Juan Soto to a contract extension prior to the 2023 MLB season. We were required to complete an analysis of who he is as a player, both currently and in the historical context of the game, come up with a future projection for how he would perform moving forward, create a contract projection to match the production projection, and then analyze how that contract would fit within the context of the Padres payroll situation. However, we did have a lenght restriction, so I furthered my analysis in the SABR Course 2 Case Study - Extended document.
