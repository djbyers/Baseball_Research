# Baseball_Research
This repository includes projects and research done for baseball/softball related projects, including work done while I was a student, both in class and with relations to the Sports Analytics Club of St. Olaf College, as well as the work necessary to complete the Society for American Baseball Research (SABR) Certification courses, and other personal passion projects.

A description of each section and the files contained within each is contained below:

## SABR Certification Material

#### SABR Course 2 Case Study

The final project to complete the level two SABR certification was a case study of whether or not the Padres should have signed Juan Soto to a contract extension prior to the 2023 MLB season. We were required to complete an analysis of who he is as a player, both currently and in the historical context of the game, come up with a future projection for how he would perform moving forward, create a contract projection to match the production projection, and then analyze how that contract would fit within the context of the Padres payroll situation, given the stipulation that the front office and ownership groups did not want to take on a ton of financial risk. However, we did have a lenght restriction, so I furthered my analysis in the SABR Course 2 Case Study - Extended document.


## Sports Analytics Club

While at St. Olaf College, I was part of a group of students that founded our Sports Analytics Club. As part of the club, we were given the opportunity to work directly with our school's varsity softball team. These files are from that work, specifically from the 2019 season.

#### St Olaf Softball Data Visualizations

This document includes a number of data visializations for one of the players on the team (Player 1) that represent how their production statistics (Batting Average, OPS, wOBA, etc) change throughouth the season, and how the underlying process statistics (hard hit %, contact %, batted ball profiles, etc) affected those changes. The time frames are broken up into roughly 8 game intervals, meaning the first data point is the value after ~8 games, the second data point is after ~16 games, and so on.
